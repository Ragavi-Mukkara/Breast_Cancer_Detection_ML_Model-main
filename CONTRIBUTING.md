# Contributing to Breast Cancer Detection ML Model

We love your input! We want to make contributing as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Local Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Breast_Cancer_Detection_ML_Model.git

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Testing
```bash
# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Run linting
flake8 .
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if needed
2. Update the requirements.txt if you add/remove dependencies
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of a maintainer

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Write docstrings for functions
